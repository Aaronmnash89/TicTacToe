#### 1) What theme/themes that you are using.

The themes we are using is VS Code, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Our group did not use Bootstrap or Java.

#### 2) Whether or not you used the slides

No, we did not use the slides. 

#### 3) If you/group decides to not use slides/assignment, please state what resources you used

We did not use the slides because resources were provided on the link listed below: 

https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#

#### 4) How you incorporate the slides or resources you used.

We incorporatated the resources used to create our code. The resource we used is the link below: 

https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html# 

However, using React resulted in our code continuously breaking. To keep our code running properly, my group and I used JavaScript. Most of the code was from the link we used, but 
we edited the code to "Run" in the terminal as JavaScript, not React.

#### Program Used: VS Code

#### Languages Used: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
